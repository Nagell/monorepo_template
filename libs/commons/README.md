# Commons Library

This library contains functions and composables used by other projects.  
You can import them in your project by using the following import statement:

```typescript
import { MyClass, MyFunction, type MyType } from "@monorepo/commons";
```

## Development

Newly created functions and components should be added to the `index.ts` file in the root of the library.
